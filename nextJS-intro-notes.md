# NextJS intro

- NextJS is a full stack framework (You can build backend and frontend both in it).
- NextJS uses React for frontend part.
- Two main reasons to use NextJS are **Performance** and **SEO**

## React VS NextJS

- React is a library, NextJS is a framework.
- You can only build component based UI using react.
- There are some features that are not available in react for which we need NextJS.
  1. Routing (routing is not by default present in react we use `react-router-dom` package).
  2. different types of rendering options like **Server side (SSR)** **Static site generation (SSG)** **Incremental static regeneration (ISR)**. Will come to these features later.
  3. Only **Client side (CSR)** is available in react by default.
  4. On the other hand NextJS provides in build routing feature (refer nextJS-routing-notes.md), multiple types of rendering options. These features together boost Performance and SEO.
